    Note: This is a research project. Only pull requests from team members will be approved. Do not fork.

Tarana is a student-facing AI chatbot designed for ICCT Colleges, built to provide quick access to announcements, schedules, and general information. The chatbot is powered by a CMS for knowledge management and uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) embedding models to deliver context-aware database search results.

This repository contains the frontend application, completely decoupled from the CMS. It is packaged as an Electron desktop app for local use.
